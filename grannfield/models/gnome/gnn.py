        This implementation follows Algorithm 1 in https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01261

        There is one difference. For the nodes update the class aggregates over the
        sender edges and receiver edges separately. This is a bit more general
        the algorithm described in the paper. The original behaviour can be
        recovered by using only the receiver edge aggregations for the update.

        In addition this implementation supports softmax attention over incoming
        edge features.

        Many popular Graph Neural Networks can be implemented as special cases of
        GraphNets, for more information please see the paper.

        Args:
          graph: a `GraphsTuple` containing the graph.

        Returns:
          Updated `GraphsTuple`.
